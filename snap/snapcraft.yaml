  Manage (Install, track, upgrade) and discover custom elements for Home Assistant directly from the UI.

  **What?*** HACS is a integration that gives the user a powerful UI to handle downloads of custom integrations and plugins.

  Highlights of what HACS can do:

  - Help you discover new custom elements.
  - Help you install (download) new custom elements.
  - Help you keep track of your custom elements.
  - Manage(Install/Upgrade/Remove)
  - Shortcuts to repositories/issue tracker

  **Installation**
  1. Go into integrations and add HACS. Home Assistant will now try to install every python-package that HACS depends on. 
  2. Step 1 might fail for an unknown reason, but **if so**:

   Restart Home Assistant with `sudo snap restart home-assistant-snap` and wait for it to boot up. Go back and continue as described in _step 1._

  3. You should be prompted with some check-boxes that you need to confirm and then a screen to connect to github api.

  Wallah! HACS should be up running. :)

  **Can't find HACS in the integration list?**

  Open up a terminal and issue: 

  ```
  sudo snap connect home-assistant-hacs:components home-assistant-snap:components
  ```

  HACS should auto-connect, but sometimes it might fail. You also have to do this manually if you are using a self-snapped `home-assistant-snap`.

  Please see https://git.giaever.org/joachimmg/home-assistant-hacs#install-from-the-snap-store-recommended for more details.

  **UPDATES? Out of date?**

  No worries. HACS is managed by HACS and Home Assistant. After installation you will be able to update HACS whenever there is a new update!
